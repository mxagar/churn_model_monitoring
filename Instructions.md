# Monitoring of a Customer Churn Model: Instructions

This file contains the summary of the instructions provided by Udacity.

The project starter file can be downloaded from here: [starter-file.zip](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/60412fe6_starter-file/starter-file.zip).

Overview of steps:

> 1. Data ingestion. Automatically check a database for new data that can be used for model training. Compile all training data to a training dataset and save it to persistent storage. Write metrics related to the completed data ingestion tasks to persistent storage.
> 2. Training, scoring, and deploying. Write scripts that train an ML model that predicts attrition risk, and score the model. Write the model and the scoring metrics to persistent storage.
> 3. Diagnostics. Determine and save summary statistics related to a dataset. Time the performance of model training and scoring scripts. Check for dependency changes and package updates.
> 4. Reporting. Automatically generate plots and documents that report on model metrics. Provide an API endpoint that can return model predictions and metrics.
> 5. Process Automation. Create a script and cron job that automatically run all previous steps at regular intervals.

Submission: ZIP with project + reports from step 4.

Udacity encourages to use the Linux Virtual machine accessed via their web interface; the starter code should be downloaded into `/home/workspace`. Even though the files persist between sessions, shell sessions are lost; additionally, the workspace closes automatically after 30 idle minutes.
