This folder contains the monitoring databases which are set up by `db_setup.py`.

> Instead of writing results and files to .txt and .csv files, write your datasets and records to SQL databases. This will lead to increased performance and reliability.

> In order to accomplish this suggestion, you'll have to set up SQL databases in your workspace. You can accomplish this within Python by installing and using the mysql-connector-python module. You could create a new Python script called dbsetup.py that used this module to set up databases. You could set up a database that stored information about ingested files, another one to store information about model scores, and another one to store information about model diagnostics. Then, you would have to alter ingestion.py, scoring.py, and diagnostics.py so that they wrote to these databases every time they were run.
